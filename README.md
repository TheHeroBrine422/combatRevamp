# combatRevampMod

Authors: Atlasted (Design & Art) & Hero (Code)


Adjusts Player Movement & Combat.

Currently Implemented:
- Dash
- Double Jump (this can be adjusted to any number of extra jumps)
- Stamina

All of these have settings inside of the combatRevamp.java file, at the beginning of the class. At somepoint these settings will be moved outside of this file. These settings wont really be used by the end user once the mod is complete and will be decided by some kind of class tree or by armor/weapons equiped
